      "tags": "naive-bayes independence conditional-independence",
      "extra": "This means that knowing the value of one feature doesn't provide information about another feature, once we know the class. Like medical symptoms: given a disease diagnosis, fever doesn't tell us about cough likelihood. This assumption is 'naïve' because features are often correlated in reality, but the classifier works surprisingly well despite this simplification. Violations of this assumption can lead to overconfident predictions and bias errors."

      "tags": "naive-bayes complexity scalability parameters",
      "extra": "This is why Naïve Bayes is practical for high-dimensional data. For 10 binary features: joint table needs 1024 parameters, Naïve Bayes only 20. The independence assumption trades modeling accuracy for computational efficiency and sample complexity. With limited training data, the parameter reduction often leads to better generalization despite the modeling bias."

      "front": "What is Laplace smoothing and why is it essential for Naïve Bayes?",
      "back": "Add α (usually 1) to all counts to prevent zero probabilities for unseen feature-class combinations",
      "formula": "\\[P(X_i = v | C = c) = \\frac{\\text{count}(X_i = v, C = c) + \\alpha}{\\text{count}(C = c) + \\alpha |V_i|}\\]",

      "tags": "laplace-smoothing naive-bayes zero-probability",
      "extra": "Without smoothing, if a feature value never appears with a class in training data, P(feature|class) = 0, making the entire prediction zero due to multiplication. This is catastrophic for new data. Laplace smoothing ensures all probabilities are non-zero. Think of it as assuming we've seen each combination at least once. The parameter α controls smoothing strength: α=1 is standard, larger α means more uniform distribution."

      "extra": "For each class c and feature i, we estimate μ_ic (mean) and σ²_ic (variance) from training data. During prediction, we evaluate the Gaussian PDF at the test point. This extends Naïve Bayes beyond categorical data to real-valued features like temperature, height, or medical measurements. The Gaussian assumption may not hold in practice, but often works well. Standardization often improves performance."

Naïve Bayes will overweight evidence when both are high/low together. Hospital admission example: diabetes and gallbladder disease appear independent overall, but given hospitalization, they become negatively correlated (if one is absent, the other is more likely present to explain admission)."

The denominator P(X) is often ignored for classification since it's the same for all classes. Use log-probabilities to avoid numerical underflow with many features."

This subtlety is crucial for understanding when Naïve Bayes assumptions are violated."

      "source": "Assignment 5 - Missing Data Handling",
      "tags": "missing-data naive-bayes robustness",
      "extra": "This is a major advantage of Naïve Bayes over many other classifiers. When a thermometer fails (missing temperature), we just exclude temperature from the calculation and use remaining features (fever, cough). The independence assumption means missing features don't affect the relationships between observed features. However, this changes the relative importance of features - fewer features means each remaining one has more weight in the decision."
