• Use regularization (Ridge/Lasso) to automatically handle correlation
• Apply PCA to reduce dimensions while preserving information","Multicollinearity means features are linearly dependent - knowing one tells you about the other. Creates redundancy without adding information.

WHY IT MATTERS:
• Redundant features don't improve model performance
• Can cause numerical instability in linear models (singular matrices)
• Makes feature importance interpretation difficult
• Increases computational cost and overfitting risk

TECHNICAL STRATEGIES:
• Remove one correlated feature (keep more interpretable one)
• Combine features (e.g., accessibility_score = 0.5*TAX + 0.5*RAD)
• Use regularization (Ridge/Lasso) to automatically handle correlation
• Apply PCA to reduce dimensions while preserving information",,"Related to condition number, variance inflation factor (VIF), feature selection",,
What is the main purpose of applying PCA before visualization?,"PCA reduces high-dimensional data to 2D or 3D while preserving maximum variance, enabling visualization of patterns and clusters",,Assignment 1 - PCA,PCA dimensionality-reduction visualization,"Like finding the best camera angles to photograph a 3D sculpture - you want views that capture the most detail with fewest shots. PCA finds the 'best angles' in data space.

PRACTICAL EXAMPLE: Iris dataset has 4 features (sepal/petal length/width) which can't be visualized directly. PCA transforms to 2D while keeping most information.

KEY INSIGHT: Human brain can only visualize up to 3 dimensions effectively. PCA projects high-dimensional data onto lower-dimensional subspace that captures maximum variance.

TECHNICAL PROCESS:
1. Standardize features (zero mean, unit variance)
2. Compute covariance matrix
3. Find eigenvectors (principal components)
4. Project data onto top 2-3 components

WHAT'S PRESERVED:
• Relative distances between points (approximately)
• Cluster structures and separability
• Major variance patterns and relationships

• Exact feature interpretability (components are linear combinations)
